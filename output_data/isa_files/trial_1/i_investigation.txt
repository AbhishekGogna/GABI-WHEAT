Study Protocol Description	Heading date (HD) - days to heading from first January in a given year, Plant height (PH) - average plant height pre-harvest, Thousand grain weight (TKW) - weight of thousand grains, Ear weight (EW) - average weight of 10 ear samples pre-harvest, Grains per ear (GPE) - average number of grains from 10 ear samples pre-harvest, Yield (GY) - plot yield, Specific weight (SW) - specific weight of grains. Grain hardiness (GH), starch content (STC), and protein content (PC) were measured using NIR grain analyzer. Sedimentation test (SDS), Hagberg falling number (HAG) and Zeleny sedimentation index (ZEL) values were recorded as described in AACC - 56-70.01, 56-81.03 and 56-63.01. Please refer to main paper for detailed descriptions.
