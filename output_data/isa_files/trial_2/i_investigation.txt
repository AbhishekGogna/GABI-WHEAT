Study Protocol Description	The protocols are defined seperately for the three parameters i.e. Resistance score to fusarium head blight (FHB), Resistance to tan spot (DTR) and Resistance to septoria blotch (SEP). Briefly, the scores are average of multiple measurements taken per plot for desease severity over the growing season in a given environment (year + location). Please refer to main paper for detailed descriptions.
